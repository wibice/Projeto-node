// import { createServer } from "node:http" 

//Function where I can pass two steps (steps ==> parametros)
// const server = createServer ((request, response) => { 
//   response.write('oi')

// return response.end()

// })

// It helps because if I have several applications running on the machine I can put each one on a port
// server.listen(3333)  

// localhost:3333
// localhost:3334

//POST = Record Creation (BASICALLY IT WILL HELP US TO CREATE);
//GET = Used in the application when I search for some information, listing, detail, etc;
//DELETE = Delete;
//PUT = change; 
//PATCH = used when I want to make only a small, specific change to a resource and not to the entire data

// Set() and Map()
  //Set() Does not accepted duplicate values.
  //Map ()
